## Clinical Diagnosis Assistant using Fine-Tuned BioMedLM (LoRA + FAISS + RAG)

This repository contains an end-to-end LLM-powered clinical diagnosis generation system. It leverages a fine-tuned version of `stanford-crfm/biomedLM` using LoRA adapters, combines it with semantic retrieval (FAISS), and uses prompt engineering to generate accurate and context-aware diagnoses for structured patient summaries.

## 🔬 Project Highlights

✅ **BioMedLM fine-tuned with LoRA** for efficient domain adaptation.  
🧠 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using a FAISS index of past discharge summaries.  
📄 **Cleaned, hallucination-free diagnosis output** using regex-based post-processing.  
🧪 **Ready-to-query inference** via `run_inference.py`.  
🧰 **Modular code structure** (tokenization, model loading, semantic search, prompt generation).  
⚙️ **Lightweight**: runs on CPU without full model retraining.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clinical-diagnosis-assistant.git
cd clinical-diagnosis-assistant
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run inference**
```bash
python run_inference.py
```

## 🔍 Sample Query

```python
query = "Patient presents with shortness of breath, chest tightness, and was admitted for 3 days under cardiology."
```

**Suggested Diagnosis and Explanation:**  
The patient is likely experiencing acute coronary syndrome. Based on the clinical history and ECG findings, the chest pain and shortness of breath suggest myocardial ischemia. Hospitalization was appropriate for further cardiac workup.
